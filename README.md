## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Recently graduate in Computer Science from University of Minnesota. Go Gophers! I am also a veteran that served with the 75th Ranger Regiment as an Infantryman during the Iraq and Afhganistan conflicts. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Home Media program that communicates solely on the home or selected local network. I would like it to be able to store, sort, and send primarily movies across a home network for viewing on any media capable device (TV, Phone, Laptop). I plan to have it use at least a web page and possibly media casting (like the iphone) for the devices. Maybe a full application at a later date. This will be broken into three seperate systems. One database-esque program to parse the media (a lot of confusing and bloated file names), store in a data structure (Linked-list, Binary Tree, or HashMap), sort that data structure, and send the requested media to the web/app server. Might merge the database and the web/app server into a single program instance.  


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# 12 and .NET 8. I believe this will help with my relatively light experience with Object Orientated Programming. I also plan to use this language/framework as the front facing and server processing side of the Media program I am attempting to create.
